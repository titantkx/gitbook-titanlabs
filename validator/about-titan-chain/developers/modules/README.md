## What are Modules?â€‹

Modules are foundational components in Titanâ€™s blockchain architecture, each built to provide specific functionalities. A module is essentially a self-contained unit with well-defined logic and services, allowing Titan to efficiently manage diverse operations across the network.

Modules work like building blocks that can be combined to expand the blockchainâ€™s capabilities. This approach reduces the friction and technical complexity of implementing core features, making development easier. Each module operates independently but communicates with others through inter-module messaging, making Titanâ€™s architecture modular and adaptable. This allows Titan to continuously evolve, delivering targeted upgrades and functionality without overhauling the entire system.
